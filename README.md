## Node JS and My Thought Process 

I am really enjoying SQL! This application will impliment a baisc CRUD (witout the delete at the moment) operation, and allow a manager/boss to edit and keep track of his employee information. I used cases for the major questions, whcih allowed my code to be short and concise. Please see seed.sql for the main parts of the database, and employees_DB for the tables the data will be stored in.
